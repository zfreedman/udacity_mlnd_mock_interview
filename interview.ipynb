    "This code runs in O(n! * m) time, where n is the length of the permutated string and m is the length of the string to find the anagram in. For a string with *n* characters, the only non-recursive (first) call runs in O(n) time, where a recursive call is made for each of the n characters. On the first recursive call for any character, the remaining *n*-1 characters will also undergo a recursive call, which continues until the remaining characters in the anagram string is 0. With this logic, *n* x *n*-1 * x ... x 2 x 1 gives n!. Searching within the comparer string requires searching over worst case *m* characters, so the time complexity is O(n!*m).\n",
