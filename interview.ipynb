    "This code runs in O(n!) time. For a string with *n* characters, the only non-recursive (first) call runs in O(n) time, where a recursive call is made for each of the n characters. On the first recursive call for any character, the remaining *n*-1 characters will also undergo a recursive call, which continues until the remaining characters in the anagram string is 0. With this logic, *n* x *n*-1 * x ... x 2 x 1 gives n!.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever permutation is involved, there's usually a recursive and iterative solution. The recursive solution here starts by taking an empty string as a default parameter and iteratively stripping the *ith* character from the testing string to build up each possible anagram. While the recursive and iterative variations require the same space complexity (something larger than n!), I find the recursive implementation easier to visualize. Additionally, the recursive solution does not require an external data structure explicitly to store the permutations as they're created, but this tradeoff comes at the expense of a deeper stack from nested function calls where the permutations actually are stored as function parameters."

    "This palindrome analyzer checks the leftward and rightward substrings from any index in a string. If the leftward substring and rightward substring are equal, a palindrome exists, and the length of each substring can be increased by 1. As it is now, the algorithm runs in O(n^2), seeing as each index of a length *n* string is iterated over once in the first loop, with at most *n*/2 iterations in the inner loop. Looking at the assignment calls, the storage for the algorithm is also O(n^2).\n",
