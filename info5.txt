Question 5
Find the element in a singly linked list that's m elements from the end. For example, if a linked list has 5 elements, the 3rd element from the end is the 3rd element. The function definition should look like question5(ll, m), where ll is the first node of a linked list and m is the "mth number from the end". You should copy/paste the Node class below to use as a representation of a node in the linked list. Return the value of the node at that position.

Note: The tests take "Find the element in a singly linked list" literally. The node is returned and the data value is queried.

Explanation
This analysis is just of the question5 function, not the linked list connector.

question5() runs in linear time. It iterates over the entire linked list at most 2 total times, with at least 1 complete iteration to get the length. Additionally, the algorithm only maintains pointers to the current node, so the space used is constant: O(1).
