Question 4
Find the least common ancestor between two nodes on a binary search tree. The least common ancestor is the farthest node from the root that is an ancestor of both nodes. For example, the root is a common ancestor of all nodes on the tree, but if both nodes are descendents of the root's left child, then that left child might be the lowest common ancestor. You can assume that both nodes are in the tree, and the tree itself adheres to all BST properties. The function definition should look like question4(T, r, n1, n2), where T is the tree represented as a matrix, where the index of the list is equal to the integer stored in that node and a 1 represents a child node, r is a non-negative integer representing the root, and n1 and n2 are non-negative integers representing the two nodes in no particular order. For example, one test case might be

question4([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0],

       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
      3,
      1,
      4)
and the answer would be 3.

Note: I'm pretty sure the input example provided is not valid input. There's 5 nodes in the tree but only 3 edges; there should be 4.

Explanation
This algorithm takes O(n) time to iterate over each element in a sublist out of n nodes in the tree. However, the height of the tree dictates how many iterations the n3 node is set to a child node, which can be accurately represented by h ~ log(n) for leaf nodes on a balanced BST. Therefore, runtime for this algorithm is O(nlog(n)), with O(1) storage.
